## Description

The E-Commerce Back End is an application built using Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL2. This program is designed to allow the user to manage their e-commerce business in the terminal and in insomnia in order to keep track of their inventory. An e-commerce back end is a helpful tool for any business owner, providing the user with the ability to observe, create, update, and delete their company's inventory in the terminal. With this application, the user no longer needs to spend time manually writing down and updating their company's inventory. Through simple mouse and keyboard usage they can quickly generate this information.
